# Time_Series
Time Series Analysis is a way of studying the characteristics of the response variable concerning time as the independent variable. In mathematics, a time series is a series of data points indexed in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data.
